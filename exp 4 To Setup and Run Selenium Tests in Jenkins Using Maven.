Aim: To Setup and Run Selenium Tests in Jenkins Using Maven.

Installed Apache Maven.
Installed Eclipse for Maven project development.
Added a Maven project in Eclipse.

Created a Freestyle project in Jenkins.
Configured the Jenkins project with appropriate settings.

In the build steps, added the path to your Maven project and the command mvn clean test, and saved the configuration.
ex-
cd  C: \Users \student \Down10ads \ maven
mvn clean test
echo success

Used the "Build Now" option in Jenkins to initiate the build process.
Observed output for both success and failure cases.

Manually ran the command mvn clean test in the command prompt and received a successful result
