Aim: To create a custom Docker image using Docker files and upload it to the Docker hub.

Steps Followed:
1.	Install Docker:
●	Download and install Docker Desktop from the official Docker website based on your operating system.
●	Follow the installation instructions to set up Docker.

2.	Download a Project from GitHub:
●	Choose a project from GitHub that contains a Dockerfile, which defines the container environment.

3.	Build a Docker Image:
●	Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the Dockerfile.
●	Run the command to build a Docker image, e.g., docker build -t welcome-to-docker.
●	This command creates an image based on the instructions in the Dockerfile.

4.	Check the Built Image:
●	Go to the Docker Desktop's Image tab to verify that the image has been successfully built.
5.	Run the Container:
●	Start a container based on the image by specifying a container name and port.
●	Runs the application in the container and maps port 3000 on your local machine to port 80 in the container.

6.	Access the Application:
●	Open a web browser and go to localhost:3000. You should see your application running in the container.

7.	Remove the Container:
●	Once you're done, you can stop and remove the container by going to the Docker Desktop's Container tab.
