Step 1: Install Docker Desktop
Download and install Docker Desktop from the official Docker website.
Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

Step 2: Setup WSL
1.	Install and Update WSL:
Open the command prompt (CMD) or PowerShell as an administrator.
Run the following command to install WSL 2: wsl --install
After the installation, reboot your system.
Once your system reboots, open the command prompt (CMD) or WSL terminal again.
2.	Update WSL:
To ensure you have the latest version of WSL, run: wsl â€“update

3.	Enable WSL Integration:
Open Docker Desktop settings.
Navigate to the "Resources" section and select "WSL Integration."
Enable the WSL integration for the desired WSL distribution.

Step 3: Pull Image 
Open the command prompt (CMD) or WSL terminal.
Run the following command to pull the "alpine" image from Docker Hub: docker pull alpine

Step 4: Check Images 
To verify that the "alpine" image has been downloaded, run: docker images

Step 5: Run Container 
Create and enter an "alpine" container using the following command: docker run -it alpine
The -it flag allows you to interact with the container using the terminal.
This command starts a new instance of the "alpine" image and opens a terminal within the container.

Step 6: Explore the Container 
You'll now be inside the "alpine" container's terminal.
You can explore the container, run commands, and interact with the isolated environment.
For example, you can try running commands like ls, echo, etc.
